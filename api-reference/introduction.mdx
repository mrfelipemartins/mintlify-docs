## Base URL

Zapply is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.
To guarantee the best performance we distribute the load across multiple servers, so you should use the base URL designated to your device.

Example of base URL:

```text
https://wa01.zapply.cloud
```

## Authentication
To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being `Bearer zpp_123456789` where `zpp_123456789` is your API key and the ID of your device in the `x-channel-id` header.

```text
Authorization: Bearer zpp_123456789
x-channel-id: 123456789
```

## Response codes

Zapply uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Zapply's servers (these are rare).

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `200` | OK - Everything worked as expected. |
| `400` | Bad Request - Often missing a required parameter. |
| `401` | Unauthorized - No valid API key provided. |
| `402` | Request Failed - Parameters were valid but request failed. |
| `404` | Not Found - The requested item doesn't exist. |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Too many requests hit the API too quickly. |
| `5xx` | Server Errors - something went wrong on Zapply's end. |
